# React Calculator with Redux and React-Router implementation

TECHCareers assignment - React Calculator

This assignment is meant to challenge your knowledge of state, prop and element rendering in React. 
React is currently one of the most popular and sought after front end technology at the moment, and having skills with it will greatly increase your employability. Redux is often used as a companion to React, and is favored for storing information over using state. React Router is used to create multiple pages in React, and is often used to keep applications and web pages organized.


## Requirements

- Create two input fields that can take in numeric values 

- Create a select (drop down box) which allows the user to choose what operation to apply to the two numeric fields - your operations must include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

- Output to the user the result of the calculation

- Store and output a list of prior calculations the user has done in a Redux store

- Use React Router to have a page for the calculator and a page for prior calculations


## Challenges

- Make it look nice with some CSS!

- Protect data input - return a message to the user if the user inputs a non-numeric character

- Have a single input field which can read the operations
